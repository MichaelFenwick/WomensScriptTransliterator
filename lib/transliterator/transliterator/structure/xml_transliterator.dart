This might cause problems if something is formatted in such a way that a block element has primary text AND another block element inside it, but we just have to hope that no one is formatting their xml files so terribly. //TODO: Maybe this could be better done by filtering away XmlElements that don't contain any XmlTexts. I'm not sure how well that will alleviate the woes encountered with epubs such as Edgedancer, and I'm not sure the result is really any better anyway in the case of weirdly formatted documents. Maybe something where each block element's XmlText and XmlElement children get processed as their textBlock in the case where both exist?

Because element.descendants will return all of these, recursively, the full textual content of any XmlElement will be the XmlTexts within the result of element.descendants. Because only the textual content should be transliterated, the first step is to filter down to only those items.

However, this is pretty sloppily shoehorned in and should be pulled into its own method. Perhaps it could be better placed in ParagraphTransliterator.transliterateAtoms(). However, the EpubHtmlFileTransliterator transliterates titles by calling SentenceTransliterator directly, so maybe the logic should go there, with something passed into that transliterator to indicate that it should be executed because the sentence isn't a proper sentence. Ellipses are a tricky thing, because in theory they should exist alongside any sentence ending punctuation, but in practice, text may omit a period on a sentence that ends with an ellipsis.
